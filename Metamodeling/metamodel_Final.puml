class Mission {
    droneGroup: DroneGroup
    actions: List<ActionElement>
    constraints: List<Constraint>
}
note left of Mission

  assigned to a drone group.
  Can include Actions or nested Missions.
end note

class DroneGroup {
    drones: List<Drone>
}
note right of DroneGroup
  Groups multiple drones
  for coordinated missions.
end note

class Drone {
    ip: String
    serialNumber: String
}
note right of Drone
  Represents an individual drone
  with its connection and identification info.
end note

class Action {
    description: String
    type: String
}

  Defines semantic links between entities,
  like inheritance or dependencies.
end note

abstract class Entity
note right of Entity

  that can participate in a relation.
end note
